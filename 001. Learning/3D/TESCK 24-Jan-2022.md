## Theory
- Blending is done by grabbing two squares and dedicating two or 3 squares for blending.
- Follow a youtube tutorial for better creation kit, e.g.Create a Nordic ruin in skyrim
- Start wherever, and continue in order, try grabbing a zone and go in order.

## Technical stuff
- Opalls to use as a kind of pallets using with obj Ctrl + Alt to place objects withought having to drag the assets.
