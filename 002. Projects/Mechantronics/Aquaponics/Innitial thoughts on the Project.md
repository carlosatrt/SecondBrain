## Hypotheis
	One Aquaponics unit is capable of sustain 1 person in a minimal area, required maintainance reduced through automation to a minimum, nearly plug and play, and the carbon print that it generates in 10 years is at least 20% less than consuming consuming everything from 3rd Party sources.

## General Objectives
- Stable Aquaponic System(Stable Nitrate Cycles).
- Sensors installed.
- Automation to correct unbalances.

## Specific Objectives
- Create an Enclosure for Fish.
- Create a tray for the Plants.
- Create a System to visualize the Input Data from the Aquaponic Sensor.
- Temperature sensing for Water, PH Sensing for Water
- 100% Solar powered
